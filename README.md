      You ended up spamming groups, getting reported left and right,
      and you ended up in a Finale Battle with Telegram and at the end
      Telegram Team deleted your account?
      And after that, then you pointed your fingers at us
      for getting your acoount deleted?
      I will be rolling on the floor laughing at you.
